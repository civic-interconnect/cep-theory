# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .gitignore.
# WHY: Prevent committing generated artifacts, local state, secrets, and OS-specific files.
# ALT: Repository may customize ignores, but MUST preserve universal safety rules.
# CUSTOM: Add repo-specific patterns in the dedicated section at the bottom.

# === Universal (all projects, all languages) ===

# WHY: Logs are useful during debugging and verification.
# ALT: Uncomment temporarily if logs must be inspected or validated.
# *.log
# logs/

# WHY: Temporary, backup, and swap files are machine-local noise.
*.swo
*.swp
*.tmp
*~
*.bak
*.backup

# WHY: Generic caches are machine-local and should not be tracked.
.cache/

# WHY: OS-generated metadata files should never be tracked.
$RECYCLE.BIN/
.AppleDouble
.DS_Store
.LSOverride
.Spotlight-V100/
.Trashes
._*
Icon\r
desktop.ini
Desktop.ini
ehthumbs.db
Thumbs.db

# WHY: IDE/editor metadata is machine-local and should not be tracked.
.idea/
*.code-workspace
.history/

# === VS Code (special case) ===

# WHY: Ignore editor state while allowing a shared baseline configuration.
.vscode/*
!.vscode/extensions.json
!.vscode/settings.json
# ALT: Commit .vscode/tasks.json only if tasks are essential to the workflow.
# !.vscode/tasks.json

# === Environment variables and secrets ===

# WHY: Never commit credentials or environment-specific configuration.
.env
.env.*
*.env

# === Documentation / site build output ===

# WHY: Static site build output is generated.
site/

# === LaTeX papers ===

# WHY: LaTeX build artifacts - regenerated on each compile

# WHY: Build directory and intermediate PDFs
build/
*.pdf

# === Project-Specific ===
# WHY: Include key reference PDFs in the repository root
!00P1_cae_ontology.pdf
!00P2_cep_semantics.pdf
!00P3_cee_verticals.pdf

# WHY: Reference PDFs - available publicly, not redistributed here
# OBS: Helps locate sources without republishing copyrighted material
# CUSTOM: Update paths if reference locations change

paper02/refs/*.pdf
paper03/refs/*.pdf
