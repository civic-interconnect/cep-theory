\midrule

\textbf{Primary Goal} 
  & Privacy-preserving behavioral transparency for civic discourse 
  & Cryptographic content provenance and media authenticity 
  & General-purpose provenance modeling for data, processes, and agents 
  & High-level platform disclosures about rule enforcement and content moderation \\

\textbf{Scope} 
  & Per-post behavioral metadata (non-identifying) 
  & Media objects (images, video, audio, composites) 
  & Arbitrary entities, activities, and agents in workflows 
  & Aggregated, platform-defined metrics \\

\textbf{Data Exposure Model} 
  & Non-identifying, bucketed, $k$-anonymous metadata ($k \ge 100$) 
  & Identifying but cryptographically secure provenance chains 
  & Full provenance graphs with arbitrary detail (often identifying) 
  & Highly aggregated statistics; limited granularity \\

\textbf{Privacy Guarantees} 
  & Formal privacy-preserving design; categorical fields; no content or IDs 
  & No inherent privacy guarantees; authenticity takes precedence 
  & None by default; depends on instance data 
  & Varies by platform; privacy not formally guaranteed \\

\textbf{Content Requirements} 
  & Content is \emph{never} accessed; metadata only 
  & Full access to media assets and transformations 
  & Any content or process can be included 
  & Platforms choose what to disclose; content optional \\

\textbf{Implementation Point} 
  & At moment of post creation (client or platform instrumentation) 
  & During media creation, editing, or distribution pipeline 
  & During data/process generation or transformation 
  & Periodic reporting (monthly/quarterly) \\

\textbf{Interoperability} 
  & JSON Schema; platform-neutral; designed for cross-platform civic analysis 
  & Standardized and widely adopted across media pipelines 
  & W3C standard; ontology-based interoperability 
  & Limited cross-platform standardization \\

\textbf{Analytical Use Cases} 
  & Coordination detection; behavioral transparency; manipulation analysis 
  & Content lineage, tampering detection, mis/disinformation robustness 
  & Workflow reproducibility; scientific data provenance; audit trails 
  & Policy monitoring; compliance reporting; coarse ecosystem trends \\

\textbf{Granularity} 
  & Post-level, privacy-bounded signals 
  & Asset-level provenance and transformation history 
  & Graph-level provenance with fine granularity 
  & Platform-defined aggregation; coarse-grained \\

\textbf{Key Strength} 
  & Strong privacy, actionable behavioral insight without content 
  & Strong authenticity and tamper-evident lineage 
  & Expressive, flexible provenance representation 
  & Broad ecosystem visibility \\

\textbf{Key Limitation} 
  & Bound by privacy constraints; some fine-grained signals suppressed 
  & Requires content access; heavier implementation cost 
  & Too expressive for lightweight transparency; privacy risks 
  & Low resolution; limited utility for scientific analysis \\
