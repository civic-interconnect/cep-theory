\section{Discussion and Limitations}
\label{sec:discussion}

CAE is intentionally conservative in its ontological commitments.
It does not attempt to enumerate all possible civic entities, nor does it claim completeness
with respect to real-world institutional complexity.
Entities are introduced only insofar as they participate in accountability-bearing relationships, and
many socially significant phenomena remain outside the scope of the ontology.

The framework does not encode causal claims, evaluative judgments, or policy prescriptions.
While CAE enables structural comparison and longitudinal analysis,
interpretation of outcomes and attribution of causality are deferred to analytic
layers built upon the ontology.
This design choice prioritizes neutrality and reusability over prescriptive modeling.

CAE also depends on the quality and availability of upstream data sources.
Incomplete, inconsistent, or biased data may limit the conclusions that can be
drawn from analyses grounded in the ontology.
However, by making structural relationships explicit, 
CAE enables such limitations to be surfaced rather than hidden.

Finally, while CAE is designed to be stable over time, real-world institutions,
laws, and measurement practices evolve.
The ontology accommodates such evolution through the addition or modification of entities and relationships without
requiring reclassification or type mutation.
This approach supports incremental extension while preserving semantic continuity.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper has introduced CAE, a categorical ontology of civic accountable
entities, as a foundational layer for formal semantics of exchange and evidence
in civic systems.
By defining a strict, disjoint partition of entity kinds and
constraining admissible relationships, CAE establishes a stable object universe
for modeling obligations, authority, actions, and outcomes.

The ontology emphasizes accountability as the unifying principle across domains,
enabling representation of long-term public investments, regulatory regimes,
financial flows, and measured outcomes without collapsing structure into
interpretation.
By separating ontological commitment from exchange semantics and
evidentiary reasoning, CAE supports interoperability, auditability, and
longitudinal analysis across jurisdictions and time.

CAE is intended to be extensible, neutral, and durable.
As a foundational layer, it enables subsequent categorical semantics of the Civic Exchange Protocol and
Contextual Evidence and Explanations while remaining independent of any
particular policy position or analytic method.
In doing so, it provides a structural basis for making civic systems and their outcomes inspectable,
comparable, and accountable.
