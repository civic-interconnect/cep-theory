NOTE: This document is an internal scope and design contract.
It is NOT part of any paper submission.

For P1: Civic Accountable Entities (CAE)

**Pre-submission checklist** for _Applied Ontology_ (IOS Press).
If every item can be answered **yes**,
the paper is less likely to be rejected for
ontological or methodological reasons.

## 1. Ontology Type and Scope

- [ ] Is the ontology type explicit (domain ontology, not a foundational ontology)?
- [ ] Is the domain clearly specified (civic accountability systems)?
- [ ] Is the scope bounded and non-exhaustive by design?
- [ ] Are inclusion criteria stated explicitly (accountability-driven inclusion)?
- [ ] Are non-goals clearly declared and respected throughout the paper?
- [ ] Is the ontology evaluated on conceptual adequacy, not implementation detail?

## 2. Ontological Commitments

- [ ] Are the core entity kinds explicitly enumerated and finite?
- [ ] Is each entity assigned exactly one kind?
- [ ] Is disjointness between kinds stated and defended?
- [ ] Are identity criteria provided for each kind?
- [ ] Do entity kinds remain invariant over time?
- [ ] Are roles, sectors, and functions modeled as relationships rather than kinds?

## 3. Methodological Alignment

- [ ] Is the ontology design grounded in established methodology (e.g., OntoClean)?
- [ ] Are rigid vs anti-rigid distinctions used correctly?
- [ ] Are continuant/occurrent distinctions discussed where relevant?
- [ ] Is comparison with foundational ontologies accurate and non-dismissive?
- [ ] Does the paper avoid redefining or partially importing foundational ontologies?

## 4. Conceptual Clarity

- [ ] Are all defined terms used consistently?
- [ ] Is each term defined in exactly one place?
- [ ] Are similar concepts clearly distinguished (e.g., Instrument vs Event)?
- [ ] Are edge cases acknowledged and resolved explicitly?
- [ ] Is ambiguity minimized through disjointness and constraints?

## 5. Relationship Modeling

- [ ] Are relationships clearly distinguished from entities?
- [ ] Are relationship constraints stated explicitly (kind-constrained)?
- [ ] Is authority modeled relationally rather than as an intrinsic property?
- [ ] Are temporal aspects confined to Events and Observations only?
- [ ] Does relationship modeling avoid semantic overloading?

## 6. Separation of Concerns

- [ ] Does the paper avoid defining exchange semantics (CEP territory)?
- [ ] Does the paper avoid defining evidence or explanation semantics (CEE territory)?
- [ ] Are category-theoretic terms entirely absent?
- [ ] Are downstream layers mentioned only at a high level and briefly?
- [ ] Can the paper stand alone without reading companion papers?

## 7. Neutrality and Non-Normativity

- [ ] Does the ontology avoid prescribing policy outcomes?
- [ ] Does it avoid evaluative or causal claims?
- [ ] Are examples illustrative rather than normative?
- [ ] Is the ontology neutral with respect to political, legal, or sectoral positions?

## 8. Examples and Competency Questions

- [ ] Are worked examples provided for each entity kind?
- [ ] Do examples use real-world civic patterns without overfitting?
- [ ] Can the stated competency questions be answered using the ontology alone?
- [ ] Do examples demonstrate discrimination between closely related cases?

## 9. Relationship to Prior Work

- [ ] Is related work discussed fairly and accurately?
- [ ] Is novelty claimed only where justified?
- [ ] Is the gap between existing ontologies and CAE clearly articulated?
- [ ] Does the paper explain why existing ontologies are insufficient for the stated goal?

## 10. Evaluation and Limitations

- [ ] Are validation criteria stated explicitly?
- [ ] Are limitations acknowledged honestly?
- [ ] Is evaluation framed conceptually rather than empirically?
- [ ] Is future work described cautiously and non-promissorily?

## 11. Presentation and Venue Fit

- [ ] Is the abstract free of category-theoretic or implementation language?
- [ ] Are keywords appropriate for _Applied Ontology_?
- [ ] Is the paper readable by ontology researchers outside the civic domain?
- [ ] Is notation minimal and explained where used?
- [ ] Does the contribution align with Applied Ontology’s emphasis on rigor and clarity?

## 12. Final Independence Check

- [ ] Could a reviewer reject or accept this paper without reading P2 or P3?
- [ ] Does no claim depend on semantics defined elsewhere?
- [ ] Are all references to CEP/CEE purely contextual and non-essential?

**If any item above cannot be checked, fix the paper before submission.**
